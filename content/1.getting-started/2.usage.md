## Request Parameters
This section provides a comprehensive explanation of the request parameters that can be utilized to tailor your API calls to Aipify.

### Required Parameters:

- `api` (string): Represents the name of the API endpoint you wish to interact with. This name is defined during the creation of the endpoint. 
  - Example: `https://api.aipify.co/your-endpoint-name`.
- `messages` (array of objects): An array of objects that symbolize the conversation history or prompts for the LLM. Each object should contain:
  - `role` (string): Can be either "system" or "user", indicating the sender of the message.
  - `content` (string): The actual content of the message.

### Optional Parameters (Body):

- `mode` (string): Determines the mode of the request. Valid values include:
  - `prompt`: This mode uses Prompt engineering techniques and defines a default system message for your request.
  - `tools`: This mode uses OpenAI Function calling to structure the response (default).
- `raw` (boolean): If set to true, the response from OpenAI is returned without any further processing.
- `cache` (boolean): If set to true, the system attempts to save the responce in the cache for future use. This can help reduce the number of tokens consumed by your API calls.

::callout
The system is set to retain `cache` for a default duration of `3600` seconds (equivalent to 1 hour). If caching is activated, and a valid, unexpired cached response is available, the system will return this response. You have the option to modify the cache retention period by adjusting the `cache_age` parameter in the request body.

### Additional Parameters (Headers):

- `Authorization` (Bearer token): A valid authorization token is necessary to authenticate requests.
- `Content-Type` (string): The type of content in the request body. The default value is `application/json`.
